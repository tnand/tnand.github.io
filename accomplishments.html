            <p>I served as the Academic Affairs Vice President of UC Irvine during my fourth and final year there. The Academic Affairs Vice President is one of the 5 executive members of the UC Irvine's student government body (ASUCI). They serve as the liaison between students and administration as the elected voice. My position was to advocate for students in terms of educational experiences by presenting students concerns to administration as well as by creating programs and events to meet current students needs.
              <ul>
                <li>Elected by entire UC Irvine undergraduate student body (25,000+ undergraduates) to advocate for student rights on matters related to their educational experience.
                <li>Coordinated a campaign team and strategies along with creating a campaign website.
                <li>Developed programming, budgets, and marketing strategies for campus-wide events.
                <li>Managed a budget of $100,000 allocated towards 43 different student programs and operations, leaving a surplus of $9,000.
                <li>Collaborated with multiple on-campus departments and local sponsors to host events.
                <li>Hired and led a diverse staff of 80 students, providing 50 internship opportunities.
                <li>Served as a member of the academic decision-making committee impacting 238,000+ students throughout the UC system.

                <li>Throughout the year I met with the Dean/ Associate Dean of every academic school on campus to discuss establishing a textbook price cap for every department.

                    <li>The school of Education implemented a textbook price cap during my term as VP :)</li>

                <li>Alternatives to Textbooks
                  <ul>
                    <li>In collaboration with the Academic Senate, (which is made up of an elected student representative for the designated school) we talked to as many professors as we could to discuss online PDF’s and cheap course readers as opposed to costly textbooks
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Worked with departments to push professors to make at least one course reserve book available in the library for students. 
                    </li>
                    <li>To cushion the cost of textbooks, I worked with the library to purchase a Knowledge Imagine Center and a few Bookeye 4 book scanner. This allowed students to scan textbooks legally without bearing the costs of course materials.
                    </li>

                    <li>Collected iClickers and calculators from students throughout the year</li>
                    <li>Spent all of my office funds at the end of the year purchasing calculators and iClickers to create a loan out program</li>
                    <li>Students often only need these materials for a class or two and this way they had the chance to rent it out for the quarter as opposed to having to purchase them</li>
