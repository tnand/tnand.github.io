            <p>Today, there are engineers who have created machine learning algorithms which are so complex- to the point where it is very difficult to understand how these algorithms are making decisions. Up until this point, society has been reactive to technology and its benefits as well as it’s consequences- especially the unintended consequences.  
            </p>
            <p>
            It is no surprise that people have become the product with tech giants such as Google and Facebook, using individual data to push consumerism. However, as a result of this we have run into a number of issues. For example, the last presidential election in the United States between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, came down to about 100,000 votes. Simultaneously, Facebook has been running a study on a campaign banner, to see if a banner on your Facebook homescreen would influence it’s users to cast a ballot. The results from the Facebook study showed that they were indeed able to influence people- roughly, 100,000 reported voters. High voter turnout, a positive thing in a democratic election system, however, Facebook ads come down to one thing, money. The more money you spend on advertising, the more results you will get. Something as small as a campaign banner now has the power to sway an individual opinion on who to vote for or whether to vote at all. This is one specific example, but we see this across many different platforms. On YouTube, you could be watching a moderately republican video and get eventually do down a rabbit hole and get suggested a KKK video.
            </p>
            <p>
            Using the internet in today’s day, means that you are putting yourself in a position to be susceptible to confirmation bias. The unintended consequences of technology, specifically artificial intelligence technology has resulted in: surveillance authoritarianism and the surveillance of data, polarization of beliefs, values, people and society, lack of transparency with algorithms and has now brought upon ethical questions for all of us. The information we digest influences us on a personal as well as a societal level, should these complex algorithms- many that we do not understand, have the power to influence us to this extent? 
            </p>
            <p>
            There is an urgent need, to start incorporating behavioral sciences into our efforts to restructure the way our digital technology operates, by looking at business models, structures and policies. My vision is to build artificial intelligence that supports our goals but is constrained by our values, AI that will contribute to our personal and societal well-being. My primary interest lies within the realm of artificial intelligence technology, specifically, on persuasion architectures in the digital world. Unlike in the physical world, online persuasion architectures have no limitations. Implemented by big tech firms to generate profit, persuasion architectures are able to target, infer and understand us. My vision is to not to change a problem we face today but instead to look into emerging technologies and create solutions for the problems we will face in the future. I want to change the world but changing the way in which we have been developing technology, which is perhaps change the world by shifting the way the current world progresses.

            <p>The way in which I will implement this vision is by producing intentional data-driven policy change at a government level, or changes to practices within organizations. I am going to business school and attaining my M.S in Disruptive Innovation as well in Business Analytics. My curriculum is designed to help me, “develop an understanding of the potential impact of emerging technologies and lead the charge in the next generation of innovation” - Hult International Business School. Through <a href="https://www.hult.edu/en/programs/masters/disruptive-innovation/">my program</a>, I will be working with other individuals interested in this niche and through collaborations we will come up with projects which will be presented to companies in the Silicon Valley/ Bay Area.

                I have already started applying for internships which to partake in while I am in my Master’s program. I am creating my own internship with companies such as: Google, Facebook, Twitter, Uber, Lyft and LinkedIn. Through this internship I will work with the companies to look at ways in which we can incorporate behavioral science research- this could be through creating a new position on software teams, designing specific research/ development projects or looking at changes the companies have made for specific products and re-evaluating them. I would like to present my personal research findings  that will help big tech giants find a balance between profit and people. I have also thought about possibly inverting my thesis ideas and look at what we as a society can do for ourselves to have some agency over emerging technology.

                <li>After my Master’s program, which is a year and a half I will be taking the last step to complete my education. I will be pursuing my PhD in the field of disruptive innovation. I am going to be applying to Harvard J.F Kennedy School of Government for Social Policy or University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill’s School of Information and Library Science. Upon receiving my PhD, I plan to teach one class, whether that be as a professor, lecturer or at a community college. An issue I ran into when looking to apply directly to doctorate programs was that there were none looking at the implications of emerging technologies. Academia is reactive and at the rapid pace at which technology is evolving, we need to create academic programs for students to encourage innovation.

                <li>I will work with various companies to updated their business models, structure and policies, I will teach to foster the curiosity of other individuals who want to explore the intersectionality between technology and society. But, the biggest way in which I will implement my vision is by pushing legislation, whether that be at a local, statewide or federal level. I will work with representatives and legislators to use data to guide the mandating of technology company practices or to create awareness for our communities so that everyone is aware of the implications of technology.

            <p>The biggest lesson I have learned from working in this last year is that accountability is everything. I want a mentor to not only guide me, but keep me accountable to my weekly and monthly goals. Through Toptal’s mentorship program, I hope to gain more than just a mentor, I hope to gain a partner. I enjoy making plans and roadmaps and I am good at getting things done, but I would love a mentor who would take the time to check in and help adjust my strategies to drive tangible results. I need a mentor who is able to foster an environment which embraces growth and provides an open space to explores ways to progress both professionally and personally. Many times I know what to do but I do not always know the best way to do it, I have hopes that a mentor will help me achieve things I otherwise would not be able to achieve by helping me problem solve as well as share personal experience and knowledge. I am ready to influence the world around me through putting dedication and diligence towards working with my mentor and I look forward to building a symbiotic relationship with my mentor, one that would allow us to collectively encourage  progressive growth for our society.
